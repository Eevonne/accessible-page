Prework Study Guide Webpage
Next, ## in markdown is a subheading. We have several subheadings in this README.

For ## Description, write a short description of the Prework Study Guide Webpage. Use the guiding questions to help you.

We don't have a long README, so you can delete the ## Table of Contents section.

For ## Installation, we don’t have any steps to take to install anything for our webpage, so write “N/A” for this section.

For ## Usage, write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.

For ## Credits, we didn’t collaborate with others nor did we use any third-party assets or tutorials, so we can write “N/A”.

For ## License, keep the MIT license that we chose when we first created the repository.

The rest of the sections don’t apply to us, but feel free to take a look.

Code Review How did you do? Let’s take a moment to review what this might look like. Review the following example of the project README and compare your results:
